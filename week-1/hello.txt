Hello there!
My name is Afolabi Mubarak, and I'm joining the Autowave Interns training from Lafia, though my roots trace back to Oyo State. 
I hold a B.Tech in Urban Design from the Federal University of Technology Minna, Niger State.
While my academic background is in shaping physical spaces, my passion lies in building digital ones as a full-stack developer. 
I'm currently immersed in working on and iterating a fascinating e-commerce project called Haya, a vibrant online fashion store catering to both men and women. 
It's a challenging and rewarding phase, especially focusing on deployment and making it shine!Beyond the screen, you'll often find me hitting the pavement. 
Running is a massive part of my life I absolutely love marathons! I draw immense inspiration from incredible athletes like Eliud Kipchoge, Sebastian Sawe, Abdi Nageeye,
and the late, great Kelvin Kiptum.And while life's current sprint and development work keep me busy, I still have a soft spot for video games, even if I don't get to play as much these days.
Excited to learn and grow with everyone here at Autowave!

My focus as a full-stack developer is primarily on the MERN stack. I find it a powerful combination for creating dynamic and efficient web solutions.
